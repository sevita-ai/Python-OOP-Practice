# Python OOP Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python programs designed to practice and reinforce core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. These examples were created during my learning journey to solidify my understanding of OOP principles through hands-on implementation.

## Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Instance and Class Methods
- Managing Lists and Collections within Classes
- Modeling Real-World Problems using OOP

## Programs Included

1. **Student Class**  
   - Stores student name and roll number  
   - Displays student information

2. **Rectangle Class**  
   - Calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle

3. **Student Marks System**  
   - Adds marks with input validation  
   - Computes average marks

4. **Bank Account System**  
   - Supports deposit and withdrawal operations

5. **Course Management System**  
   - Enrolls students in a course  
   - Calculates average grade  
   - Identifies the course topper

## Purpose

These programs serve as practical exercises to demonstrate fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and basic data modeling in Python. They are ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding through simple, well-structured examples.
